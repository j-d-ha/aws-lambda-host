///     Overloads for <see cref="ILambdaApplication.OnShutdown(LambdaShutdownDelegate)" /> that
///     support automatic dependency injection for shutdown handlers.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Source generation creates the wiring code to resolve handler dependencies, using
///     compile-time interceptors to replace the calls. Instead of using the base delegate, declare
///     handler parameters to be automatically injected from the dependency injection container. A
///     scope is created for each handler invocation, and the container is disposed of after the
///     handler returns.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
///     <code>
///     lambda.OnShutdown(async (ILogger logger, DbContext database) =>
///     {
///         logger.LogInformation("Shutting down");
///         await database.FlushAsync();
///     });
